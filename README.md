# Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica AI system instructions and code
In this repository you will find:
* Sample AI system instructions that we used to enhance metadata for the Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica at the University of Pennsylvania.
* Sample Python code we used with Google Gemini's API to create metadata at scale. This code requires a spreadsheet that has existing metadata fields per the system instructions. This code includes a feature that temporarily downloads IIIF images and reads them to enhance metadata. Note that metadata will not be generated if there is not an IIIF manifest.
